## Customer Churn Prediction

This Python project is dedicated to predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. This code orchestrates essential tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insightful data visualizations.

### Key Features:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
  - Loads customer data from a CSV file.
  - Implements preprocessing strategies to create training and testing sets.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model on the training set.
  - Evaluates the model's effectiveness using the test set.

- **Data Visualizations:**
  - Presents visual insights into churn distribution.
  - Illustrates tenure distribution.
  - Displays a plot correlating monthly charges with tenure.

- **User Interface for Prediction:**
  - Engages users in providing data for a new customer.
  - Utilizes the trained machine learning model to predict the potential churn status for the new customer.
